### Lesson Overview

This module focuses on applying the principles of the performance efficiency pillar to your workloads. In traditional, on-premises environments, achieving high and lasting performance is challenging. Using the principles in this module will help you build architectures on AWS that efficiently deliver sustained performance over time.

This module is intended for those in technology roles, such as chief technology officers (CTOs), architects, developers, and operations team members. After reading this module, youâ€™ll understand AWS best practices and strategies to use when designing a performant cloud architecture. This module does not provide implementation details or architectural patterns.

The Performance Efficiency pillar includes the ability to use computing resources efficiently to meet system requirements, and to maintain that efficiency as demand changes and technologies evolve.

## Part 1 - Performance Principles

There are five design principles for performance efficiency in the cloud:

- **Democratize advanced technologies:** Make advanced technology implementation easier for your team by delegating complex tasks to your cloud vendor. Rather than asking your IT team to learn about hosting and running a new technology, consider consuming the technology as a service. For example, NoSQL databases, media transcoding, and machine learning are all technologies that require specialized expertise. In the cloud, these technologies become services that your team can consume, allowing your team to focus on product development rather than resource provisioning and management.
- **Go global in minutes:** Deploying your workload in multiple AWS Regions around the world allows you to provide lower latency and a better experience for your customers at minimal cost.
- **Use serverless architectures:** Serverless architectures remove the need for you to run and maintain physical servers for traditional compute activities. For example, serverless storage services can act as static websites (removing the need for web servers) and event services can host code. This removes the operational burden of managing physical servers, and can lower transactional costs because managed services operate at cloud scale.
- **Experiment more often:** With virtual and automatable resources, you can quickly carry out comparative testing using different types of instances, storage, or configurations.
- **Consider mechanical sympathy:** Understand how cloud services are consumed and always use the technology approach that aligns best with your workload goals. For example, consider data access patterns when you select database or storage approaches.

## Part 2 - Best Practice for Performance 

There are four best practice areas for performance efficiency in the cloud:

- Selection
- Review
- Monitoring
- Tradeoffs

Take a data-driven approach to building a high-performance architecture. Gather data on all aspects of the architecture, from the high-level design to the selection and configuration of resource types.

Reviewing your choices on a regular basis ensures that you are taking advantage of the continually evolving AWS Cloud. Monitoring ensures that you are aware of any deviance from expected performance. Make trade-offs in your architecture to improve performance, such as using compression or caching, or relaxing consistency requirements.


### Selection
The optimal solution for a particular workload varies, and solutions often combine multiple approaches. Well-architected workloads use multiple solutions and enable different features to improve performance.

AWS resources are available in many types and configurations, which makes it easier to find an approach that closely matches your workload needs. You can also find options that are not easily achievable with on-premises infrastructure. For example, a managed service such as Amazon DynamoDB provides a fully managed NoSQL database with single-digit millisecond latency at any scale.

Use a data-driven approach to select the patterns and implementation for your architecture and achieve a cost effective solution. AWS Solutions Architects, AWS Reference Architectures, and AWS Partner Network (APN) partners can help you select an architecture based on industry knowledge, but data obtained through benchmarking or load testing will be required to optimize your architecture.

Your architecture will likely combine a number of different architectural approaches (for example, event-driven, ETL, or pipeline). The implementation of your architecture will use the AWS services that are specific to the optimization of your architecture's performance. In the following sections we discuss the four main resource types to consider (compute, storage, database, and network).


### Review

Cloud technologies are rapidly evolving and you must ensure that workload components are using the latest technologies and approaches to continually improve performance. You must continually evaluate and consider changes to your workload components to ensure you are meeting its performance and cost objectives. New technologies, such as machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI), can allow you to re-imagine customer experiences and innovate across all of your business workloads.

Take advantage of the continual innovation at AWS driven by customer need. We release new Regions, edge locations, services, and features regularly. Any of these releases could positively improve the performance efficiency of your architecture.


### Monitoring
After you implement your workload, you must monitor its performance so that you can remediate any issues before they impact your customers. Monitoring metrics should be used to raise alarms when thresholds are breached.

Amazon CloudWatch is a monitoring and observability service that provides you with data and actionable insights to monitor your workload, respond to system-wide performance changes, optimize resource utilization, and get a unified view of operational health. CloudWatch collects monitoring and operational data in the form of logs, metrics, and events from workloads that run on AWS and on-premises servers. AWS X-Ray helps developers analyze and debug production, distributed applications. With AWS X-Ray, you can glean insights into how your application is performing and discover root causes and identify performance bottlenecks. You can use these insights to react quickly and keep your workload running smoothly.


### Tradeoffs

When you architect solutions, think about tradeoffs to ensure an optimal approach. Depending on your situation, you could trade consistency, durability, and space for time or latency, to deliver higher performance.

Using AWS, you can go global in minutes and deploy resources in multiple locations across the globe to be closer to your end users. You can also dynamically add read-only replicas to information stores (such as database systems) to reduce the load on the primary database.
